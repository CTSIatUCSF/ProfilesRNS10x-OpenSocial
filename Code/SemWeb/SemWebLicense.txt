-------

The source files and binaries are all GPL-compatible.

Most of the source files were written by me, some source files were 
written by or are derived from other work, and the binaries are a mix of 
the above. So the particular license that applies in each case may be
different. However, everything included can be reused under the terms
of the GPL (if not something more permissive, depending on what it is).

The portions of this library not written by someone else are Copyright 
2005-2008 Joshua Tauberer, and are dual-licensed under both the GNU GPL 
(version 2 or later) and the Creative Commons Attribution License. All 
source files not listed below were written originally by me. Thus for 
those source files written by me, you have two license options.

The following components of this library are derived from other works:

sparql-core.dll is based on the SPARQL Engine by Ryan Levering,
which is covered by the GNU LGPL.  The original Java JAR was
coverted to a .NET assembly using IKVM (see below).  Actually, I've
made numerous changes to the library so it can take advantage of
faster API paths in SemWeb.
See: http://sparql.sourceforge.net/

IKVM*.dll are auxiliary assemblies for running the SPARQL
engine.  IKVM was written by Jeroen Frijters.  See http://www.ikvm.net.
The IVKM license is the zlib license, which is GPL compatible.

Euler.cs is adapted from Jos De Roo's JavaScript Euler inferencing
engine.  See: http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/ The original source
code (and thus this derived file) was licensed under the W3C Software
License, which is GPL compatible. 

SQLServerStore.cs was contributed by Khaled Hammouda and is licensed
under the GPL.
